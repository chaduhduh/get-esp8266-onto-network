# get-esp8266-onto-network
Code for esp8266 Feather DEV board to allow changing networks via HTTP requests. This simulates "smart" devices connect to your network step. This allows you to get esp8266 onto your network without code uploading. This contains the wrapper code for the connection then and you can simply add the logic to be performed when a user is connected. Great starting point for a Wifi enabled device project.

Once connected you can initiate tunnel connection to communicate with external servers or other devices. Read data from services via HTTP, connect to tunnel for real time control of device etc.
